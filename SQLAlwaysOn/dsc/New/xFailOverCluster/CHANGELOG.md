    ([issue #62](https://github.com/PowerShell/xFailOverCluster/issues/62)).
  - Now all parameters in the README.md list their data type and type qualifier
    ([issue #58](https://github.com/PowerShell/xFailOverCluster/issues/58)).

  - Added VS Code workspace settings file with formatting settings matching the
    Style Guideline ([issue #67](https://github.com/PowerShell/xFailOverCluster/issues/67)). That will make it possible inside VS Code to
    press SHIFT+ALT+F, or press F1 and choose 'Format document' in the list. The
    PowerShell code will then be formatted according to the Style Guideline
    (although maybe not complete, but would help a long way).
